        Smart contracts are the foundational building blocks of Web3 ecosystems.
        They automate trust, enable decentralized finance, govern DAOs, and
        power everything from NFTs to cross-chain token swaps. Yet, with great
        power comes immense responsibility. A single vulnerability,
        misconfiguration, or malicious clause can result in catastrophic
        financial losses, exploitative behavior, or reputational collapse.
        <br /> <br />
        At Algorethics, we believe that smart contract security isn&apos;t just
        about technical soundnessâ€”it&apos;s also about ethical integrity. Our
        Carlo Smart Contract Audit solution goes beyond conventional audits by
        combining static and dynamic analysis with ethical impact scoring,
        governance fairness, and regulatory readiness
        <br /> <br />
        Whether you&apos;re launching a DeFi token, staking contract, NFT
        collection, or governance DAO, Carlo provides a comprehensive,
        compliance-aware, and values-driven audit designed to meet the
        expectations of developers, regulators, and investors alike.
